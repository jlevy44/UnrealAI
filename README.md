## Unreal AI

Hey everyone! My name is Joshua Levy and I'm starting an Open Source AI project with a group of friends. There are some really interesting projects that I would like to work on as a machine learning enthusiast, and I know many people of many different talents. Believe me, this is not our day job, but I hope this serves as a medium to be expressive, intellectually stimulated, and learn some new skills along the way.

Without further-a-do, here are some initial projects that I'm interested in working on:

* Unreal Engine with Python + AI
  * Using Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks to have a car teach itself to drive.
  * Generate new organisms and have them teach themselves how to walk through GA + NN, Spore?
  * https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython
* Generating new Music through GA + NN (Maybe LTSM) and conversion of music to and from images (deep learning)
* Visualize a book through semantic and syntactic NLP Machine Learning and image recognition
  * Images are generated as you read the book
* Recreate mental images through ML on Neuron Networks in mind, cube model perhaps..
* Simulating longitudinal social networks
* Studying how anarchic organizational patterns influence social networks, and consequently the flow of ideas that can influence productivity (maybe involvement of Social Physics)
* MNIST Tests with GAs and NN; high complexity models but trying to avoid overfitting

These are just some ideas. I'll add more, and we can also start a blog to document our progress and show off our knowledge and new skills.

We need people of all backgrounds to help with development. Particularly, we need:
* Data Scientists
* C++ programmers
* Python programmers
* Modelers/Designers/Artists
* Data Visualization Experts
* People who like to write about stuff
* Mostly, people with an interest looking for some fun and learning!!!

Let's explore together. Stand by for updates.
